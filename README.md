ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex and I'm currently studying to become a frontend web developer with my end goal being a full stack developer. I started learning programming through Minecraft modding at the age of 14 and fell in love with it. My aspirations were always to become a games developer but that opened up during University where I realised I'd love to get a job in either web or software development.

I'm currently learning React along with Typescript, testing libraries like Jest and react-testing-library, and hoping to soon progress to Next.js, Firebase and Docker. I'd love to collaborate on any open source web related projects or pair with a beginner/immediate designer to work on a project together. If you'd like to reach me then feel free to send me an email to alexgama.97@outlook.com or find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexgama97/
