ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex and I'm currently working as a fulltime Javascript developer with my end goal being to work in the .NET ecosystem as a Software Engineer. I started learning programming through Minecraft modding at the age of 14 and fell in love with it. My aspirations were always to become a games developer but that opened up during University where I realised I'd love to get a job in either web or software development.

I'm currently improving my .NET skills with a basic data storage project called Census with a focus on TDD and CI/CD. The project would hopefully be used in a Unity game I'm in the process of planning/developing. I'd love to collaborate on any open source web related projects or potentially pair with a beginner/immediate designer to work on a project together. If you'd like to reach me then feel free to send me an email to alexgama.97@outlook.com or find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexgama97/
